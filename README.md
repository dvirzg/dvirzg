### Hi 👋 I'm Dvir.

Mathematical Physics student at the University of Waterloo. I like to work on causal inference, AI/ML, quantum, and behavioral science.

Check out my [causal modeling work](https://github.com/Blood-Glucose-Control/causal_modeling), or the [Media Transformations mac app](https://github.com/dvirzg/Forge), my version of [Jannote](https://github.com/dvirzg/jannote) with customized functions and database, or perhaps [autocmd](https://github.com/dvirzg/autocmd) for a natural language interactive shell, maybe my work from the [Perimeter Institute in causal inference](https://github.com/dvirzg/causal_inference_public) repo or anything else you're interested in!

Learn more about me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dvirzg) or [dvirzg.com](https://dvirzg.com)
