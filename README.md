Previously ML Engineer at Cash App, Research Assistant at Perimeter Institute, and Data Scientist at Intact Insurance. I work on causal inference, AI/ML, quantum foundations, and behavioral science.

## Projects

**[Causal Modeling for Blood Glucose Control](https://github.com/Blood-Glucose-Control/causal_modeling)**  
Building causal models to understand how insulin timing and dosage affect blood glucose levels using FitBit and Gluroo data. We compared and implements methods inc T4 Framework, Causal Transformers, Counterfactual Reccurent Network with Balanced Representations, and G-Net for counterfactual prediction.

**[Forge](https://github.com/dvirzg/Forge)**  
A local macOS media utility with a liquid glass UI. Process images (AI background removal, format conversion), PDFs (merge, rotate, extract), videos (trim, convert to GIF), and text..

**[Jannote](https://github.com/dvirzg/jannote)**  
My customized fork of Jan (open-source ChatGPT alternative) with custom action functions and a local database for building and mentioning files, prompts, and contexts easily.

**[autocmd](https://github.com/dvirzg/autocmd)**
