### Hi, I'm Dvir

Mathematical Physics student at the University of Waterloo. I work on causal inference, AI/ML, quantum computing, and behavioral science.

## Projects

**[Causal Modeling for Blood Glucose Control](https://github.com/Blood-Glucose-Control/causal_modeling)**  
Building causal models to understand how insulin timing and dosage affect blood glucose levels using FitBit and Gluroo data. Implements advanced methods including T4 Framework, Causal Transformers, and G-Net for counterfactual prediction.

**[Forge](https://github.com/dvirzg/Forge)**  
A high-performance macOS media utility with a liquid glass UI. Process images (AI background removal, format conversion), PDFs (merge, rotate, extract), videos (trim, convert to GIF), and text—all locally with complete privacy.

**[Jannote](https://github.com/dvirzg/jannote)**  
My customized fork of Jan (open-source ChatGPT alternative) with enhanced functions and database capabilities for running LLMs locally.

**[autocmd](https://github.com/dvirzg/autocmd)**  
Natural language to shell command converter. Transform plain English prompts into executable shell commands using LLMs, with support for multiple providers (Claude, GPT, Groq, Deepseek).

**[Causal Inference Research](https://github.com/dvirzg/causal_inference_public)**  
Research from the Perimeter Institute on causal inference with hidden confounders. Includes DAG unpacking, compatibility testing, inflation methods, and distribution generation using nonconvex quadratic programming.
